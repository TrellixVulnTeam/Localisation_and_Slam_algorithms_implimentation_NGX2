# SLAM and Localisation Implimentation

Using Cyril course on yourtube on slam and three parts series of iterative close point,
Probabilistic robotics and introduction to mobile robotics as well as a couple of papers

These contains some implimentaion of slam and localisation algorithms a few are excercies but rest will be compatibele with simulator

I own no credit to the simulator used


# Graph slam useage
This is a map building algorithm and is required to use localisation algorithms

provisions to be able to switch slam algorithms will be added maybe with args ðŸ™ˆ
